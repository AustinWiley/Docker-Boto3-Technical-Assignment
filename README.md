# Docker-Boto3-Technical-Assignment


### Overview

This app is Containerized with Docker. The container will take the names of two AWS S3 buckets in a single region (e.g. us-east-1) and a threshold size in MB.  Arguments that will be passed on to the Python application that can copy all files greater than the threshold size from one bucket to another.

## Docker Image

* Click the link to get an Image of the app from dockerhub. [Docker-Image](https://hub.docker.com/u/awiley)
* Or enter this in the commandline: `docker pull awiley/technical-assignment`

##

### Instructions

1. Copy the Docker image to your computer.
2. Open a docker teminal (im using Docker toolbox) and enter the following in the terminal:

   * Replace keys with your own keys

   * This command will create and run a Docker container and pass your AWS s3 access keys at the runtime as environment variables

```
docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key-id -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key -it awiley/technical-assignment
```


3. Once the Container is runing it will prompt for three arguments:

   * `Enter source bucket name: `

   * `Enter destination bucket name: `

   * `Enter threshold size in MB: `

   * Once the app runs it will tell you how many files were transfered and the container will stop running.
